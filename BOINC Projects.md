It can be a bit confusing finding projects to crunch since there are so many. Some are defunct or have filled their purpose. Here's some that are reasonably active.
If you plan on signing up for several projects or managing several machines, the BOINC Account Manager can make this much faster and quicker. It is a good idea to have a minimum of two projects in case one project runs out of work or is temporarily down. You can set your less preferred project to "0" weight/resource share so it will only be crunched if your primary project is out of work.


⚠️ I haven't thoroughly researched each project's options/history/etc so this is a work in progress. If you know of anything which should be added/removed/updated, please add it in the comments.

# Key:

🔓 - Publishes data openly and regularly. Note many projects publish papers detailing the results of their work, this icon means that they regularly publish the source materials as well/the results of the computation in an open fashion.

💚 - Supports NVIDIA GPU/graphics card  (all projects should be assumed to support CPU unless otherwise stated)

❤️ - Support AMD GPU (all projects should be assumed to support CPU unless otherwise stated)

✒️ - Cites BOINC and BOINC volunteers in their scientific papers or other publications (such as a database of astronomical objects citing the BOINC user who found it)

🎓 - Sponsored by major university or research institute.

# 🧬 Medicine/Biology 🧬

💚❤️ GPUGrid - Full-atom molecular simulations of proteins. Requires GPU for computation.

️🔓✒️ SiDock@home Works on drug discovery with COVID-19 as its primary focus, developing open-source COVID-19 drugs.

🎓🔓Denis@home - Work on modeling to help solve heart disease!

🎓TN-Grid - The gene@home project is an implementation of the PC-IM algorithm, whose purpose is to expand Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN). Each network is a  graph that specifies the causal relationships inside this set of genes,  and helps in studying the gene expression phenomenon: the process  through which the DNA is transcribed into RNA and the RNA translated into proteins.

🎓 Rosetta@home - Protein structure prediction that may ultimately lead to finding cures for some major human diseases. (often low on work). Warning: workunits require a lot of memory, many require virtualbox.

# ☂️ Umbrella Projects ☂️

Umbrella projects focus on several different areas of science

💚🎓 World Community Grid - Mostly focused on medical research, projects have included research on AIDS, Zika, COVID, and rainfall patterns. Run out of Krembil institute

Yoyo@home - Brings existing distributed computing projects to the BOINC world using the BOINC Wrapper technology. Mostly math but some biology as well.

# ⚛️ Physics ⚛️

🎓 LHC@home - Process data from the large hadron collider/CERN.

# 🔭 Space 🔭

🎓💚🔓 Asteroids@home - Asteroid research - it uses photometric measurements of asteroids observed by professional big all-sky surveys as well as 'backyard'  astronomers. The data is processed using the lightcurve inversion method and a 3D shape model of an asteroid together with the rotation period  and the direction of the spin axis are derived. Publishes a database of all findings

🔓✒️ Einstein@home - Search for spinning neutron (pulsars) stars using data from the LIGO  gravitational-wave detectors, the Arecibo radio telescope, and the Fermi  gamma-ray satellite. All results published in an open database and credited to users.

🎓💚❤️✒️ Milkyway@home -  Creation of a 3D map of the Milky Way galaxy using data gathered by the  Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This project enables research in both astroinformatics and computer science.

🎓🔓 Universe@home - Search for astronomical objects and phenomenon including black holes.

🎓Gaia@home - Infrequent work, research on comets and other space phenomenon.

# 🔣 Math 🔣

💚🔓 Amicable Numbers  Independent research project that uses  Internet-connected computers to find new amicable pairs. Currently searching the 10^20 range.

🎓🔓 NFS@Home - Lattice sieving step in Number Field Sieve factorization of large  integers. Many public key algorithms, including the RSA algorithm, rely  on the fact that the publicly available modulus cannot be factored. If  it is factored, the private key can be easily calculated.

🎓🔓 Numberfields@home - Research in number theory. Number theorists can mine the data for  interesting patterns to help them formulate conjectures about number  fields.

🔓 ODLK1 - Building a database of canonical forms of diagonal Latin squares of the 10th order

🔓 SRBase - Attempting to solve Sierpinski / Riesel Bases up to 1030.

🔓PrimeGrid - Find new prime numbers!
Gerasim@home - research in discrete mathematics and logic control. Testing and comparison of heuristic methods for getting separations of  parallel algorithms working in the CAD system for designing logic control systems

🔓 Loda@home - LODA is an assembly language, a computational model, and a distributed  tool for mining programs. You can use it to generate and search programs  that compute integer sequences from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences®  (OEIS®). The goal of the project is to reverse engineer formulas and  efficient algorithms for a wide range of non-trivial integer sequences.

🔓🎓Rakesearch - The enormous size of the diagonal Latin squares space makes it  unfeasible to enumerate all its objects straightforwardly in reasonable  time. So, in order to discover the structure of this space,   sophisticated search methods are needed. In RakeSearch project, we  implement an application that picks up separate pairs of mutually  orthogonal DLSs, which allows to reconstruct full graphs of their  orthogonality.

🔓✒️ Ramanujan machine - Discover new mathematical conjectures

# 🧮 Other 🧮

🎓Climateprediction.net - Predict climate patterns. Warning: huge workunits, may take a week to complete!
iThena - Make a map of the internet! Sporadic work, some CPU-intensive while other network intensive. Measurements project is network intensive, computation project uses CPU.

# 💻 Non-BOINC volunteer computing projects 💻

🎓✒️ Folding@home - Protein folding/medical research.

DreamLab - Medical research on Android phones

# ⚠️ Don't Crunch/Dead Projects ⚠️
